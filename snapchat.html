     <h2>Snapchat</h2>
     <p> Snapchat is a very commonly used social media app to to text and send snaps(which are pictures you take and put an added text with the picture). It has grown since its development in 2011 and is highly used by teens and younger adults to contact friends. It has grossed around â‚¬600 million last year.</p>

     <h3>How does that relate to Education</h3>
     <p>Considering Snapchat is all around the world and is used by all age groups mostly teens and young adults. It presents an opportunity for schools and colleges/universities to use this to develop and progress work in education. As more people spend time on their phones this would help students and teachers if they somehow made it possible to transfer or work from devices mainly secondary schools. Also taking screenshots and passing reminders to students or even classmates would prove really eficient as teachers should connect with how the modern world works now and take advantage of it.</p>
